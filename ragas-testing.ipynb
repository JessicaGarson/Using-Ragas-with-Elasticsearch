      "The Island of Doctor Moreau by H.G. Wells: Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, The Time Machine, not its potential for misuse and terror. In The Island of Dr. Moreau, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells’s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing “smarter” human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick’s adventures on Dr. Moreau’s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.\n",

But what if there's one man in this blasted universe who just won't stop getting under her skin? What if she can't help but lust after him? Fates be damned, isn't that what's important?  Driven to always succeed, Darien is one of the commander's chosen few. Above all his fellow warriors, he serves at the leisure of his general. But lately, someone else has been commanding his time... Mad with need to claim her sexy body as his own, Darien will not stop at anything in his quest to keep Deliya safe. And more importantly, as his own. Fates be damned, he will have that woman.

Driven by an intense religious extremism, the Olyix are determined to bring everyone to their version of god as they see it. But they may have met their match in humanity, who are not about to go gently into that good night or spend the rest of their days cowering in hiding. As human ingenuity and determination rises to the challenge, collective humanity has only one goal--to wipe this apparently undefeatable enemy from the face of creation. Even if it means playing a ridiculously long game indeed.But in a chaotic universe, it is hard to plan for every eventuality, and it is always darkest before the dawn.\n",
