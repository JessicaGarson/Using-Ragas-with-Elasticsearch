What's a good science fiction book with high ratings?,"['The Island of Doctor Moreau by H.G. Wells: Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, The Time Machine, not its potential for misuse and terror. In The Island of Dr. Moreau, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells’s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing “smarter” human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick’s adventures on Dr. Moreau’s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.', ""Alien Warrior's Mate by Vi Voxley: He's damn impossible and he won't stop at anything to claim her...  Deliya is one of the best of the best. An elite warrior, few things have ever phased her. She works hard and plays hard, all for the day when fates decide it's time for her to meet her fated mate. But what if there's one man in this blasted universe who just won't stop getting under her skin? What if she can't help but lust after him? Fates be damned, isn't that what's important?  Driven to always succeed, Darien is one of the commander's chosen few. Above all his fellow warriors, he serves at the leisure of his general. But lately, someone else has been commanding his time... Mad with need to claim her sexy body as his own, Darien will not stop at anything in his quest to keep Deliya safe. And more importantly, as his own. Fates be damned, he will have that woman.  When death lurks behind every stone and in the hands of every enemy they encounter, can Darien and Deliya find their love, or will death claim them first?  Alien Warrior's Mate is a standalone book with a happy ever after ending and no cliffhanger.

What's a highly rated mystery novel?,"[""On the Steel Breeze by Alastair Reynolds: It is a thousand years in the future.
